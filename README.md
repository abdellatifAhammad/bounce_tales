## Introduction

I am a big fan of old Nokia games, and Bounce Tales is one of my all-time favorites. I decided to create this clone in JavaScript to relive some of my childhood nostalgia.

## Features


This clone will include most of the features of the original Bounce Tales game, such as:

- A variety of different levels
- Different types of obstacles
- Power-ups
- Bosses
- Multiple difficulty levels

## Development Tools

I used the following tools to develop this game:

- MelonJS JavaScript game engine
- Inkscape vector graphics editor
- Tiled map editor
- Free-Tex-Packer texture packer


I hope you enjoy playing this Bounce Tales clone (don't forget to give it a ⭐)!
